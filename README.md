# Background
Arkanoid is a classic arcade game developed back in 1986, in which the player controls a paddle that can bounce balls which break bricks on impact
and accumulate score. When all the bricks on a level have been broken, the level is finished and a new level starts, and when all the balls have fell
below the paddle the game is lost.
This is an Arkanoid game made as a project in the Introduction to Object Oriented Programming course (89111) at Bar-Ilan University.
The game is programmed entirely in the Java programming language and uses the biuoop-1.4 JAR file.

# Arkanoid
The game contains four levels and accepts as arguments integers which define the order of the four given levels. A level can be added to the order
of levels a multiple amount of times and in changing order, and if an invalid level is selected (i.e. level 5 or 'Direct Hit') it will be ignored.
You can press P to stop the game and Space to resume playing.
When finishing all the levels in the given order, or losing at a level, a screen showing if you won or lost will pop up and show your final score. It
can be closed by pressing the Space key.
